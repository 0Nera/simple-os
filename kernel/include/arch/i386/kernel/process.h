// Saved registers for kernel context switches.
// Don't need to save all the segment registers (%cs, etc),
// because they are constant across kernel contexts.
// Don't need to save %eax, %ecx, %edx, because the
// x86 convention is that the caller has saved them / shall save them
//  if the caller need it
// Contexts are stored at the bottom of the stack they
// describe; the stack pointer is the address of the context.
// The layout of the context matches the layout of the stack in switch_kernel_context.asm
// Switch doesn't save eip explicitly,
// but it is on the stack and create_process() manipulates it.
